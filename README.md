## Gesture Recognition Accuracy

Our latest model improves gesture recognition accuracy by **15%** compared to the previous version.

- **Previous accuracy:** 80%
- **Current accuracy:** 92%

This was achieved by [mention improvements, e.g., adding more training data, optimizing preprocessing, tuning hyperparameters, using a better model architecture, etc.].
